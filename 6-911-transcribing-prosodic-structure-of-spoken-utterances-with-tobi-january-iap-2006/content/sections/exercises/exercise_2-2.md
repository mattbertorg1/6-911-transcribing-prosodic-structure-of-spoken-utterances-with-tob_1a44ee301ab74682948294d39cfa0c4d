Section 2.2 L\* H-H% ([ZIP](/coursemedia/6-911-transcribing-prosodic-structure-of-spoken-utterances-with-tobi-january-iap-2006/81df517ef5346e75f00e221fa9f467bd_exercises22.zip)) (The ZIP file contains: 9 .textgrid, 6 .wav, and 1 .pdf files.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Listening Exercises
----------------------

1.  Just listen and focus on the prosody. The following file has various speakers producing various texts, all with a single L\* pitch accent and the H-H% phrase accent-boundary tone combination. (ex2a1various.wav) (_for Abernathy, me, tarnation, a minimum, really, and are you recording_)

B: Labelling Exercises
----------------------

Label the following files, using the TextGrids provided. (For each file, you should find TextGrid with the words tier filled.) Files may contain Intonational Phrases with H\* L-L% as well as L\* H-H%, but each individual phrase will still have only a single pitch accent.

1.  ex2a1marianna.wav (_Marianna)_
2.  ex2a2amelia.wav (_Amelia knew him_)
3.  ex2a3vegs: an utterance with several Intonational Phrases, spoken by the same speaker (_some beans, some arugula, a rutabaga, an onion_)
4.  ex2a4various: several short utterances by the same speaker strung together (_banana another banana arugula marmalade marmalade a ToBI labeller_)

C: Further Exercises
--------------------

1.  Produce, record and compare L\* H-H% from L\* H-H% models. The file ex2c1\_luminary.wav has examples of 2 different speakers saying the words a luminary with L\* H-H%. Record your own rendition(s) and save your files. (use ex3c1, and your initials: ex3c1 \_amb.wav)
2.  Produce both H\* L-L% and L\* H-H% on the same set of words. Try the following list (and feel free to add to it): me, you, banana, another banana, a lime, arugula, watermelon, an umbrella, marmalade, a minimum, a ToBI labeller
3.  Work with a partner to produce "dialogs": H\* L-L% in response to L\* H-H%, and vice versa. You can use words from the list above, or choose your own.
    *   eg:  
        speaker 1: a banana? (L\* H-H%)  
        speaker 2: a banana. (H\* L-L%)  
        or  
        speaker 1: some marmalade. (H\* L-L%)  
        speaker 2: some marmalade? (L\* H-H%)  
        or  
        speaker 1: a rutabaga? (L\* H-H%)  
        speaker 2: no. (H\* L-L%)
4.  Try producing L\* H-H% versions on a longer phrase or two. In section 2.1, you heard the H\* L-L% contour on several longer phrases. (You may also have tried your own H\* L-L% renditions on the same text in exercise C3 of section 2.1). For this exercise, try to produce the same text as in the files below, but with the L\* H-H% contour.  
      
    "He said you would." (said-would1.wav) (L\* on "said")  
    "Marianna won it." (won-a.wav) (L\* on "Marianna")  
    "He was nominated." (nominated-Hstar.wav) (L\* on "nominated")
    *   save your soundfiles as .wav files, and any associated TextGrids, named with "ex2c4" and your initials, and a number or keyword if you produce more than one sound file (eg. ex2c4amb2.wav or ex2c4amb\_won.wav).
